# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWallet project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | 330ph            | 2 weeks            |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 380.5ph          | 2.3 week           |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 351              | 2.2 week           |

\*( Assuming 8 hours per day, 5 days per week and a team of 4 people,)

The estimation based on size is not extremly precise considering that the LOC produced are not constant and can vary alot during the production of the code, this makes the estimation not very precise and can lead to underestimate or overestimate the effort needed.
Considering the other two approaches to estimate the time and effort needed they are surely more precise but with the estimation by activity the over estimation is more prone to happen sicne the time reserved for each activity can be easily be more than needed.

All three methods don't share consistency between them, this is probaly caused by the fact that each one of them approaches the problem from different sides.
